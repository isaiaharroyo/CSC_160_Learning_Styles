        <h1>Prep: Learning Styles</h1>
                
        <p class="one">While there are differences in their approaches to education, there are hints of commonality in the intentions and philosophies of Carol Dweck and Derek Muller. The first being their belief about "capitalizing on mistakes and confronting deficiencies." For Carol, this is a trait of an individual with a Growth Mindset, which is the belief that intelligence is not a fixed trait, but rather a characteristic that can be further developed. Her stance is that obstacle confrontation is imperative to the growth and development of intelligence. For Derek, while many may view his approach to "capitalizing on mistakes" as insulting or degrading to the people he is talking to, he is helps people "learn the truth" by learning from what they previously missunderstood, rather than just telling the information.</p>
        
        <p class="two">Another way Dweck and Muller are similar in their approaches is that they want their methods to encourage individuals to seek out knowledge "at all cost." This is how Dweck characterized individuals who demonstrate a Growth Mindset from those who represent a fixed mindset. The Growth Mindset, doesn't obtain information for the purpose of "looking smart", but rather for the sole purpose of learning. Much like Dweck, Muller hopes that the people he talks to "seek out the truth in their own lives", echoing Dweck's ideas about learning at all costs.</p>
        
        <p class="three">One thing that I remember from learning about these styles of learning in the past is that the transition between a Fixed Mindset and a Growth Mindset is not an easy one. It is not as simple as waking up one day and incorportating a new mindset into your daily life. It takes a long time of adjustment, development, and growth. One of the things that is important is to not hide from any failures or mistakes. Considers those events as learning curves and use them as opportunities to better oneself for the next obstacle.</p>
